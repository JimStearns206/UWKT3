Topic: Utilizing Spray Data

I’ve been thinking about an attribute for the spray data.

Any model is an approximation of reality. So is any particular attribute. There are gaps in knowledge (certainly mine!) and in data, so assumptions must be made. Here goes.

* What kind of spray is CDPH using - adulticide or larvicide? It matters because larvicide involves a delay between administering the spray and noting the effects (i.e. fewer adults will hatch three days later).

* I’m assuming that CDPH is using adulticide. The 2013 spray data has a timestamp. The CPDH spraying is done at night. Adulticides are sprayed at night when most mosquitos are flying instead of resting [1]. Larvicides are applied to water; I’m thinking daylight is more conducive for such an operation. So, adulticide.

* Adulticides are a fog. Fogs dissipate, so there’s a limited time of effectiveness. I will assume one night. 

* Mosquitos must come into contact with the fog to be killed. So I’ll assume effectiveness declines with increased distance between spray application and trap, reaching zero at say, one kilometer.

* Adulticide fog floats with air currents. Sure wish I could take wind direction and speed into account, but due to limited time, I think we’re going to have to punt on accounting for wind.

* Spray is administered in the evening. I’m assuming that nearby trap measurements next day will be affected. 

* The spray data needs to be massaged a bit. Most all of the 2013 sprayings were done between 6PM and midnight. About 1% done between midnight and 1AM. Five entries out of 14K+ were around 10AM. Typos or real? Dunno. I suggest we treat every spray as occurring at 12:01AM; that simplifies the date compare between trap and spray data. That means for evening sprays we’d use a date one day later. 2011 spray data has no timestamp; let’s assume that all were evening (pre-midnight) sprays.

* Putting this all together could lead to a “Same-Day Spray Proximity Index”. Range 0 to 1. Zero if no spray within a kilometer of that trap that day, one if a spray within a tenth of a kilometer that day, with a linear ramp with distance.

Comments would be much appreciated.

Does this look worth doing? Just a small matter of programming :-)

Thanks,

Jim
